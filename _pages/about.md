** **  

* Hi, I am Zipeng.
* I am a PhD student in the Laboratory for Energy System Analysis at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) and in the Institute of Energy and Process Engineering of ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
* My research interests are sustainability assessment, life cycle assessment and material flow analysis. I am focusing on technology specification and sustainability assessment of low carbon fuels in future scenarios to reach a net-zero emission.

* I did my Masters in Environmental Science at ETH Zurich, during which I stayed at Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) for one year for an internship and master thesis.
* Previously, I received my Bachelor in Environmental Science from Tongji University, China (2015-2019), with a short internship at UN Environment in Kenya in 2019.
