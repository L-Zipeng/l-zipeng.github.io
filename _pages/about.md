Hi, I am Zipeng.

* I am a PhD student in the [Laboratory for Energy System Analysis](https://www.psi.ch/en/lea) at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) and in the [Institute of Energy and Process Engineering](https://ipe.ethz.ch/) of ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
* My research interests are sustainability assessment, life cycle assessment and material flow analysis. I am focusing on technology specification and sustainability assessment of low carbon fuels in future scenarios to reach a net-zero emission.
* I did my Masters in Environmental Science at ETH Zurich, during which I stayed at [Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA)](https://www.empa.ch/) for one year for an internship and master thesis.
* Previously, I received my Bachelor in Environmental Science from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/), China (2015-2019), with a short internship at [UN Environment](https://www.unep.org/) in Kenya in 2019.
