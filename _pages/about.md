* Hi, I am Zipeng.
* I am a PhD student started in March 2022 in the Technology Assessment group at the Paul Scherrer Institute and in the Chair of Energy System Analysis at ETH ZÃ¼rich.
* My research interests are sustainability assessment, life cycle assessment and material flow analysis. 
* My PhD work will focus on technology specification and sustainability assessment of low carbon fuels in future scenarios to reach a net-zero emission.
* I obtained Master's degree in Environmental Science from ETH Zurich in February 2022. 
* I stayed at EMPA for one year for an internship and master thesis, focusing on probabilistic dynamic material flow analysis and environmental emissions of plastics.
* Previously, I received his Bachelor in Environmental Science from Tongji University, China (2015-2019), with a short internship at UN Environment in Kenya in 2019.
