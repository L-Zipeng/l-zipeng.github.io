excerpt: 'There are currently increasingly concerns over DNA damage related to free radicals due to their vital roles in human health, especially high-performance detection method. Herein, we report an ultra- sensitive monitoring of DNA damage associated with free radicals exposure using interdigitated electrode (IDE) array for the first time.'
